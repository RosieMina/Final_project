## Overview: Selected Topic, reason, Descripstion of data source and questions to be answered 

## Our Topic
- The topic we chose for the final project is World Suicide Rates. We decided to pick this topic because because we know that mental health is a huge crisis right now especially with so many nuaces with technology. We wanted to see how suicide rates that changed over the years. We understand that there are many factors in the lives of  individuals around the globe which can lead to suicide and we want to see which factors may or may not have the greatest influence according to our dataset.

## Our Source
- The dataset we will use for our project is the "Suicide Rates Overview from 1985 to 2016". The dataset we decided on has data from 1990 to 2015 it also includes columns for the following: Country, Year, # of suicides, age, population, suicides rate per capita, GDP for that year, generation. This dataset coveres a lot of ground when it comes to a topic like this which can help us find correlations between the statistics that are represented.

## Questions to be answered
- Some of the questions we want to answer are the following:
1) Are younger generations more susceptible to mental health crisis and suicide?
2) Which sex is commiting suicide at a higher rate worldwide?
3) Which regions(contidents, 1st world v 3rd world) of the world are committing suicide at the higher rate?
4) Does the country's economic state(GDP) affet suicide rates?
5) Over the years has suicides and bad mental health become a silect pandemic?



## Communication Method

- As a team we communicate through slack and on a GC through text, we connect on Wednesdays for 3 hours to work on the project and we utilize the time in class. Everyone has a role, we also help each other with our roles when needed.

We came across an error importing our csv onto the table. I and another team member tried importing the data on our own seperate computers and we came across the same issue. We've also used both methods of creating a table and importing the data as well as copying the table when looking online for help. There could possibly be an issue with how our data is being read in postgres. We spoke to the TAs about this during class time and the error is still here. We also tried joining office hours but because of the holidays we were unable to get a hold of anybody.
